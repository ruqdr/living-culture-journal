## Introduction
Tapas are a quintessential part of Spanish culture. These small, flavorful dishes are more than just food—they are a social ritual that brings people together.

## History of Tapas
The tradition of tapas dates back centuries. One popular legend says that King Alfonso X of Castile recovered from an illness by eating small portions of food with wine, leading to the custom of serving small snacks with drinks.

## Regional Variations
- **Andalusia:** Famous for *gazpacho* and *pescaíto frito* (fried fish).
- **Basque Country:** Known for *pintxos*, elaborate small bites served on bread.
- **Catalonia:** Offers *pa amb tomàquet* (bread with tomato) and *escalivada* (roasted vegetables).

## Social Significance
Tapas encourage sharing, conversation, and a relaxed pace of life. In Spain, it is common to go *de tapas*—hopping from bar to bar, trying different dishes and socializing with friends.
